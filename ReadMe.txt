1. For the adressbook problem, I chose to have two classes, Entry and Phonebook. The Entry class has two variables, a string for the name and one for the number, a function compare which returns 1 if the current entry has to be ordered with respect to the one that we pass to the function. The Phonebook class has our phonebook stored in a LinkedList, some functions for adding and removing our entries and also some functions for finding an element of the list by typing either the name or the number of that contact. In this class we also have a function to sort our adressbok with respect to the name of the contacts.
